# Threat-Awareness 

Detection, monitoring, correlation, CTI & hunting: 
- Wazuh Server (SIEM): collection/analysis of logs and alerts. 
- AIC (AI Correlation): correlation/pruning/RCA to reduce alert overload and add context. 
- AIBD (AI-Based Detector): multi-view ML for heterogeneous IT/OT anomaly/attack detection (planned for advanced Pilot 2 phases). 
- FLAD (Federated Learning Anomaly Detector): real-time detection/classification using federated learning (validated in specific pilot environments). 
- RCTI: robust CTI with IoB (Indicator of Behaviour), PP-CTI (privacy-preserving sharing), and MISP Server. 
- THF/DFIR: threat hunting and forensics with AI-assisted workflows and reporting.
